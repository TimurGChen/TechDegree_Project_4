 OOP Game Show App

Game - Phrase Catcher

Programmed with OOP principles in mind, the game asks the player to guess a phrase
by clicking on on-screen keyboard or typing on the device key board.

CSS Dark Mode Adjustments:
     To comfort the eyes of players addicted to the game and continue to play when the
sun goes down and lights are out, the darker version features an overall darker color
theme.

Major Adjustments:
1. Sets the background color of main_container div to black.
2. Sets the win color to transparent dark green, allowing player to see their guess before
    resetting the game.
3. Sets the lose color to transparent dark red, allowing player to see how they make their
    final mistakes.
4. Sets the on-screen keyboard button color, and chosen/wrong colors, so that they are darker and
    more in-sync with the styling of displayed and hidden letters.
